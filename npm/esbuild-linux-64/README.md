# @prantlf/esbuild

This is the Linux 64-bit binary for esbuild, a JavaScript bundler, minifier and analyser. See https://github.com/prantlf/esbuild for details.

This is an experimental fork of the [original project](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) to explore the [pure dependency analysis](https://github.com/prantlf/esbuild/commits/analyse) and [AMD.JS support](https://github.com/prantlf/esbuild/commits/amdjs).
